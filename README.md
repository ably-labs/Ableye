# rosie-demo

This is my demo project using Go and Ably Realtime.

I want to create a tool which can be used to do exploratory testing of Go SDK
Similar to how Postman can be used to exploratory testing of an API

## Setup 
If you don't have one already, [create a new Ably account](https://ably.com/sign-up)

Create a new environment variable called `ABLY_PRIVATE_KEY` and set it to your Ably private key.
